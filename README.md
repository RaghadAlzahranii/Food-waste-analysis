Food Waste Analysis

By Raghad Alzahrani

üìñ Description:

This notebook presents an analysis of global food waste in honor of World Food Day. It explores food waste by region and sector, estimates how many people could have been fed using the wasted food, and calculates the environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions. The analysis provides actionable insights supported by data visualizations to raise awareness and drive discussions on reducing food waste, feeding more people, and addressing climate change.

üìä Key Insights:

	‚Ä¢	Total Global Food Waste: 930 million tonnes per year.
	‚Ä¢	People Who Could Have Been Fed: 1.86 billion people annually.
	‚Ä¢	Total CO2 Emissions from Food Waste: 2.33 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

Food Waste by Sector:

	‚Ä¢	Households: 569 million tonnes/year
	‚Ä¢	Retail: 118 million tonnes/year
	‚Ä¢	Food Services: 244 million tonnes/year

üìÇ Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:
Kaggle Dataset: Food Waste Data

üìë Steps for Analysis:

	1.	Import Libraries and Load Data
Load the necessary libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, and read the dataset into a dataframe.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct a preliminary exploration of the dataset, including checking for missing values, duplicates, and understanding the shape and features of the data.
	3.	Calculate Key Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Total food waste globally across households, retail, and food services.
	‚Ä¢	People who could have been fed using wasted food (assuming 500 kg of food per person per year).
	‚Ä¢	Carbon emissions resulting from food waste.
	4.	Data Visualizations
Create static plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize:
	‚Ä¢	Food waste by region and sector.
	‚Ä¢	Carbon emissions by region.
	‚Ä¢	Total food waste by sector.

üîç Key Notes:

	‚Ä¢	The interactive Plotly visualizations used in earlier versions of this notebook are not included in this final version.
	‚Ä¢	The plots generated by this notebook are static and designed for easy export to HTML or PDF.
	‚Ä¢	To view the full notebook and run the analysis interactively, including viewing the visualizations, please use Google Colab.

üñºÔ∏è Plots and Visualizations:

The following visualizations are included in the notebook:

	‚Ä¢	Bar chart of Food Waste by Region and Sector (tonnes/year).
	‚Ä¢	Bar chart of Total Food Waste by Sector (tonnes/year).
	‚Ä¢	Carbon Emissions breakdown by region.

	Note: All plots can be viewed when running the notebook on Google Colab or another local environment where the libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) are properly installed.
