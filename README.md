Food Waste Analysis

By Raghad Alzahrani

üìñ Description:

This notebook presents an analysis of global food waste in honor of World Food Day. It explores food waste by region and sector, estimates how many people could have been fed using the wasted food, and calculates the environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions. The analysis provides actionable insights supported by data visualizations to raise awareness and drive discussions on reducing food waste, feeding more people, and addressing climate change.

üìä Key Insights:

	‚Ä¢	Total Global Food Waste: 930 million tonnes per year.
	‚Ä¢	People Who Could Have Been Fed: 1.86 billion people annually.
	‚Ä¢	Total CO2 Emissions from Food Waste: 2.33 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

Food Waste by Sector:

	‚Ä¢	Households: 569 million tonnes/year
	‚Ä¢	Retail: 118 million tonnes/year
	‚Ä¢	Food Services: 244 million tonnes/year

üìÇ Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:
